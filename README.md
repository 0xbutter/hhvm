# HipHop for PHP

HipHop for PHP is an open source project developed by Facebook. HipHop offers a PHP execution engine called the “HipHop Virtual Machine” (HHVM) which uses a just-in-time compilation approach to achieve superior performance. To date, Facebook has achieved more than a 6x reduction in CPU utilization for the site using HipHop as compared with Zend PHP.
