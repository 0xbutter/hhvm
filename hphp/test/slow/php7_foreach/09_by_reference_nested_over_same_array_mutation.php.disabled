/* This currently doesn't work because:
 * 1) the unsets promote the array from packed to mixed
 * 2) the promotion shows up as an array replacement, so the inner foreach
 *    then updates its pointer from the array's internal pointer
 * 3) the inner foreach keeps iterating, eventually moving the array's internal
 *    pointer past the end
 * 4) by the time the outer foreach sees that the array has changed, the array's
 *    internal pointer is past the end, so it stops iterating.
 *
 * See extra_by_reference_nested_over_same_array_mutation_mixed.php which shows
 * that this works as expected in the RFC if the array starts out as mixed.
