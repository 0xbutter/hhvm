Before binding

bound: no

bound: no
scoped to A: bool(true)
bound: no
scoped to A: bool(true)

After binding, no instance
scoped to A: bool(false)

After binding, with same-class instance for the bound ones
HipHop Warning: %a
scoped to A: bool(false)
bound: no
scoped to A: bool(false)
bound: A (should be scoped to dummy class)
HipHop Warning: %a
scoped to A: bool(true)
bound: no
scoped to A: bool(true)

After binding, with different instance for the bound ones
scoped to A: bool(false)
bound: B (should be scoped to dummy class)
scoped to A: bool(true)
bound: B
Done.
