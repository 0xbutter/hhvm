(5,10)-(5,17) No method inside an interface may be declared 'abstract'.
(8,1)-(11,1) Class C1 contains an abstract method and must therefore be declared abstract
(10,10)-(10,17) Classes cannot both contain abstract methods and be non-abstract. Either declare 'abstract class C1', or make 'function c3' non-abstract.
