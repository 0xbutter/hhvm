Linearization for class \A:
[\A(child)]
Linearization for class \T:
[\T(child), \A<mixed>(req ext)]
Linearization for class \B:
[\B(child), \T(trait), \A<mixed>(trait, synthesized), \A<int>(parent)]
Linearization for class \C:
[\C(child), \B(parent), \T(parent), \A<mixed>(parent, synthesized), \A<int>(parent)]
