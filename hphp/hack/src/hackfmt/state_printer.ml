  (* When printing a chunk group, we want to print a newline after and not
   * before. This corresponds with the way trailing trivia works (the final
   * token in the chunk is associated with the trailing newline) and the
   * expectations of range-formatting at line boundaries.
   *
   * However, chunks are associated with the split preceding them, so if we
   * print a newline character before every chunk whose associated split is
   * broken on, we will print the chunk group with a leading newline and no
   * trailing newline. Instead, we don't print a newline before the first chunk
   * we print, and do print a trailing newline if the last chunk in the range is
   * bound to have a newline after it. *)
