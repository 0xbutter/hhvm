(** Note: the tracking in this module is for approximate logging purposes only;
 * it's not guaranteed to always reflect accurate merge base transitions:
 * - in some init types, initial merge base is not known so we will only notice
 *   the second transition
 * - to avoid blocking rest of the system, mergebase queries time out after 30
 *   seconds and are not retried in case of errors
 * - we only record "new" mergebases as we see them, not detecting transitions
 *   between already visited revisions
 *
 * In other words: do not depend on anything in this module for things more
 * critical than logging (like HackEventLogger.set_changed_mergebase ())
 **)
