(* Typed AST.
 * We re-use the NAST but annotate expressions with position *and*
 * type not just position. The type is optional, the idea being that *if*
 * present then it should be correct according to the typing rules, and if
 * absent it should be cheaply and uniquely derivable from the subexpressions,
 * given particular types for local variables.
 *
 * Going forward, we will need further annotations
 * such as type arguments to generic methods and `new`, annotations on locals
 * at merge points to make flow typing explicit, bound type parameters for
 * `instanceof` refinements, and possibly other features.
 *
 * Ideally we should record anything that is computed by the type inference
 * algorithm that can't be deduced again cheaply from the embedded type.
